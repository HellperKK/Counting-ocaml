# Counting-ocaml

Ways to count in ocaml (and still counting !)
A project to experiment programming in Ocaml using the simplest programm
I could think of.

Source files are in the src folder.

# How to run

`ocaml file.ml` or `ocaml src/file.ml` from root

# How to contribute

The best way to contribute is to add your own file into the src folder following
the template `CO_Anumber_FileName.ml`

Why do so ?

Because it's fun !
